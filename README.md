# JWAS
This library provides the code for all JWAS simulation case scenarios and the code for applying this novel DCI-derived model on data from COPDGene Project.


This ssumption-free, DCI-derived model to cover all genetic variants without emphasize on additivity of classic GWAS models and normality of residuals in the regression model. Implemented rigorous simulations and replicated GWAS with data from COPDGene Project. Controlled for Type I error rate and discovered variants in different genetic modes of transmission
