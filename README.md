# JWAS
This library provides the code for all JWAS simulation case scenarios and the code for applying this novel DCI-derived model on data from COPDGene Project.

This assumption-free, DCI-derived model covers all genetic variants without emphasize on additivity of classic GWAS models and normality of residuals in the regression model. This novel Controlls for Type I error rate and discoveres variants in different genetic modes of transmission like dominant recessive variants that GWAS failed to detect.
